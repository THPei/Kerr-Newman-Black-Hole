# Kerr-Newman-Black-Hole
Creating the substantial Kerr-Newman Black Hole
The numerical method is to calculate the formation structure of the Kerr-Newman black hole, and we consider the Kerr-Newman metric as the mathematical basis to discuss the model that we propose in the manuscript "Ting-Han Pei, “The Finite-Size Nuclear Structure of The Black Hole,” Preprints-111905 (Under review). doi: 10.20944/preprints202109.0354.v2."
